      “The Scientist” is a documentary that traces the story of Nobel prize nominee Dr. Raphael Mechoulam from his early days as a child of the Holocaust in Bulgaria, through his immigration to Israel, and his career as the chief investigator into the chemistry and biology of the world’s most misunderstood plant. Dr. Mechoulam ascertained that THC interacts with the largest receptor system in the human body, the endocannabinoid system (ECS).

        Dr. Rachna Patel: The Medical Marijuana Expert</h3>

      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A4-jet2OFcc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      What’s the right strain of medical marijuana for my medical condition?

      A lot of times I get asked the question, Hey Dr. Patel, what’s the right strain of medical marijuana for my medical condition? And you know what it's a difficult question for me to answer. The reason is that strains are named pretty arbitrarily.

      What do I mean by this?

      Basically, an OG Kush that you buy from one dispensary may not have the same effect as an OG Kush that you buy from another dispensary.

      It's the same even if you go to buy the OG Kush at the same dispensary. The OG Kush that you buy the second time around may not have the same effect as the OG Kush you bought the first time.

      If you're using marijuana for medical reasons, then what you're aiming for are consistent results.

      To get these consistent results, what you really want to be focusing on are the exact amounts of the chemicals in the marijuana. These are chemicals like THC and CBD, for instance.

      I hope you found that little tidbit of information helpful. As always, if you have questions for me, post them in the comments section below. I’ll be more than happy to answer them in the next video.

    Join our constant high in Bong Appetit, a new show about the wonders of weed-infused drinks and beverages. Throughout the series, we will be introduced to the many uses of marijuana—from curing the body to just smoking it for a good time.

    In our first episode, host Matt Zimbric heads to a secret Californian medical marijuana garden run by Nonna Marijuana, a 91-year-old grandmother who cooks classic Italian with a twist. Using buds grown by her own daughter, Nonna teaches Matt a foolproof method for infusing cannabis into butter, then guides him through preparing Chicken "Pot-cciatore" and gnocchi in ganja butter. Along the way, she explains how and why she recommends medical marijuana to those in need—without ever getting high on her own supply. Matt, on the other hand, may regret going back for seconds.
