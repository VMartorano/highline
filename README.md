# Agency Week - Group
Goal:

* To demonstrate knowledge of working on a fully featured Ruby on Rails project in a group environment.

Assignment:

You have been hired by an entrepreneur to build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for him to present to potential investors. You will be placed into a small group of your classmates to serve as the dev team at your agency working on this project.

To begin Agency Week, you will pitch your project idea to an Angel Investor (your instructor). Once approved, you will have a week to build out an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the investor, and present the project to a panel of staff and instructors.

During the week, a staff member will serve as the Product Manager, and have regular check-ins with you to make sure the project is on track for the investor. These check-ins will cover progress in the following areas:

* User Experience
* Product Road Map
* Future Features
* Overall Design
* Code Quality (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Ruby)

This group project is one of your many chances to apply what you’ve learned about web development in this class to a project you can show your peers, instructors, and potential employers.

The project itself will be a full-featured Rails web application. You’re welcome to incorporate any additional frameworks or libraries that you think may improve the overall quality of the product, but not required.

You should be using Git + Github to collaborate on the project. Collaboration should include creating issues, assigning tickets and feature requests, and submitting pull requests and merging.

The MVP will be due at the end of the week, and will be presented to a panel of staff and instructors for a final grade. The product itself will be graded based on the following categories:

* User Experience
* Overall Design
* Code Quality
* Originality
* User Experience:

How hard is it to use your application and does it look nice?
Is the user challenged to do simple tasks or is it easy for them to navigate around and use your application?
Design:

Does your application have good typography, color scheme, and layout by modern design standards?
Is there a good mix of imagery and text on your website?
Code Quality:

Is your code indented correctly?
Are you using DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles like wrapping repeated view code in helpers and repeated methodologies in functions and classes?
Are you sure you could explain all of the code in your project if asked, or is it too disorganized?
Originality:
Has the exact same product been built before?
Is this product useful to a tangible demographic?

You’ll be working on your projects and workshopping in class, but you are expected and encouraged to put in a large amount of work outside of class. You only have one week to build this product, so make sure to keep the term “MVP” in mind!

Best of luck with your projects and as always, questions are encouraged!

Grading Criteria:

* Project should run without crashing under normal  circumstances
* Project demonstrate a clear purpose or goal its attempting to reach
* Project should demonstrate quality code in all areas
* Project should have a consistent and approachable UI throughout
* Project should be somewhat unique

* Complete = Meets all grading criteria above.

* Incomplete = Does not meet all grading criteria. Needs improvement or missing submission.
